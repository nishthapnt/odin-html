    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dense flourless chocolate cake that's rich and fudgy.<br/>
        Perfect for a decadent chocolate dessert and for those of us who can't tolerate wheat or gluten.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>18 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until completely dissolved; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour chocolate into the bowl of an electric mixer.</li>
        <li>Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into chocolate until combined.</li>
        <li>Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into chocolate until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
        <li>Have a pan larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in the larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet. Place cake in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for 10 seconds and invert onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
